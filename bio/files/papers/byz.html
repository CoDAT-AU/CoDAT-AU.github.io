We study the problem of devising wait-free shared
memory consensus protocols that tolerate Byzantine processes (i.e.,
processes that have suffered a Byzantine fault).
We show that weak wait-free Byzantine consensus can be achieved, but only by
using ``nonresettable'' shared objects, that is, objects whose state
cannot be reset to an initial state (by any sequence of permissible
operations). With resettable objects, even a single Byzantine process
is enough to prevent any solution to weak wait-free Byzantine
consensus. Our impossibility result holds even if we can limit every
process (including Byzantine processes) to invoking objects in a
particular fixed set (i.e., impose access-control). Although
this limited-access model restricts the amount of damage a
Byzantine process can do, the restriction is not powerful enough to
enable a solution using resettable objects. 

<p>
This paper was the first to suggest the use of access-control in
shared memory as a way to make the issue of tolerating Byzantine
faults non-trivial, since otherwise a single faulty process can
corrupt the entire memory.
