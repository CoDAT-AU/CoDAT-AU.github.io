An iteration system is a set of assignment statements whose
computation proceeds in steps: at each step, an arbitrary subset of
the statements is executed in parallel. The set of statements thus
executed may differ at each step; however, it is required that each
statement is executed infinitely often along the computation. The
convergence of such systems (to a fixed point) is typically verified
by showing that the value of a given variant function is decreased by
each step that causes a state change. Such a proof requires an
exponential number of cases (in the number of assignment statements)
to be considered. In this paper, we present alternative methods for
verifying the convergence of iteration systems. In most of these
methods, upto a linear number of cases need to be considered.
