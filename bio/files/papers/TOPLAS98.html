Methods for synthesizing concurrent programs from temporal logic
specifications based on the use of a decision procedure for testing
temporal satisfiability have been proposed by Emerson and Clarke and
by Manna and Wolper.  An important advantage of these synthesis
methods is that they obviate the need to manually compose a program
and manually construct a proof of its correctness. One only has to
formulate a precise problem specification; the synthesis method then
mechanically constructs a correct solution. A serious drawback of
these methods in practice, however, is that they suffer from the state
explosion problem.  To synthesize a concurrent system consisting of
$K$ sequential processes, each having $N$ states in its local
transition diagram, requires construction of the global
product-machine having at least $N^K$ global states in general.  This
exponential growth in $K$ makes it infeasible to synthesize systems
composed of more than 2 or 3 processes.  In this article, we show how
to synthesize concurrent systems consisting of many (i.e., a finite
but arbitrarily large number $K$ of) similar sequential processes. Our
approach avoids construction of the global product-machine for $K$
processes; instead, it constructs a two-process product-machine for a
single pair of generic sequential processes. The method is uniform in
$K$, providing a simple template that can be instantiated for each
process to yield a solution for any fixed $K$.  The method is also
illustrated on synchronization problems from the literature.
