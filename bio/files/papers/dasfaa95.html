Heterogenous systems arise when preexisting or legacy information systems are 
integrated in such a way as to preserve their autonomy and past applications. 
<i>Workflows</i> are the semantically appropriate units of activity in
such environments.  They involve a variety of tasks and are best
represented by different extended transaction models or combinations
thereof. We present an approach by which workflows can be efficiently
scheduled. Our novel contribution is an event algebra in which
dependencies characterizing workflows can be declaratively
expressed. We show how to symbolically process these dependencies to
determine which events can or must occur, and when. Our approach can
represent dependencies compactly and reason with them efficiently.
