{\it Workflows} are composite activities that can be used to support and
automate multisystem applications involving humans, heterogeneous databases
and legacy systems.  The traditional atomic transaction
model, successful for centralized and homogeneous applications, is not
suitable for supporting such workflows.
%The lack of database support has led to workflows being coded
%procedurally in an {\it ad hoc} manner.    
{\em Intertask dependencies}, which are conditions involving
events and dependencies among workflow tasks, are used to specify
the coordination requirements among the workflow tasks and are a central
component of most workflow models.  They form a basis for developing
a uniform formal framework for workflows, which is a key contribution of
this work.
%They can handle different extended transaction models as well as tasks in general,
%thereby providing the level of support that application developers
%need.  
In this paper, we formalize intertask dependencies using temporal
logic.  This involves event attributes, which are needed to determine
whether a dependency is enforceable and to properly schedule events.
Each dependency is represented internally as a finite state automaton
that captures the computations that satisfy the given dependency.
Sets of automata are combined into a {\em scheduler} that produces
global computations satisfying all relevant dependencies, thus
enacting the given workflow.  This algorithm is rigorously proved
correct; it has been implemented.
