We present a compositional model of dynamic systems, based on I/O
automata \cite{LT89}.  In our model, automata can be created and
destroyed dynamically, as computation proceeds.  In addition, an
automaton can dynamically change its signature, that is, the set of
actions in which it can participate.  This allows us to model
mobility, as discussed in \cite{AL01}, by enforcing the constraint
that only automata at the same location may synchronize on common
actions.


<p>
Our model features operators for \intr{parallel composition},
\intr{action hiding}, and \intr{action renaming},
and a notion of \intr{simulation} from one dynamic system to
another, which can be used to prove that one system implements the
other.
Our model is hierarchical: a dynamically changing system of interacting
automata is itself modeled as a single automaton that is ``one level
higher.'' This can be repeated, so that an automaton that represents
such a dynamic system can itself be created and destroyed. We can thus
model the addition and removal of entire subsystems with a single
action.

<p>
We establish fundamental compositionality results for DIOA: if one
component is replaced by another whose traces are a subset of the
former, then the set of traces of the system as a whole can only be
reduced, and not increased, i.e., no new behaviors are added.  In other
words, trace inclusion is monotonic with respect to parallel
composition.  This permits the refinement of components and subsystems
in isolation from the entire system.  We establish two such
results. First we establish that trace inclusion is monotonic with
respect to parallel composition in a ``static'' system in which no
automaton is created or destroyed.  That is, if in
$A_1 \pl \cdots \pl A'_j \pl \cdots \pl A_n$ we replace $A'_j$ by $A_j$, and
the traces of $A_j$ are a subset of the traces of $A'_j$,
then the traces of the resulting system are a subset of the traces of
the original system.
Our second result is that trace inclusion is monotonic with respect to
automaton creation: if a system creates automaton $A_j$ instead of
(previously) creating automaton $A'_j$, then its set of traces is
possibly reduced, but not increased.
We show that trace inclusion is monotonic with respect to automaton creation
in a dynamic system only under certain
conditions. Specifically, if automaton creation is not correlated with
external behavior, then trace inclusion is not monotonic with respect
to parallel composition.

<p>
Our trace inclusion results enable a design and refinement methodology
based solely on the notion of externally visible behavior, and which
is therefore independent of specific methods of establishing trace
inclusion. This provides much more flexibility in refinement than a
methodology which is, for example, based on the monotonicity of
forward simulation with respect to parallel composition. In the latter
every automaton must be refined using forward simulation, whereas in
our framework different automata can be refined using
different methods.
