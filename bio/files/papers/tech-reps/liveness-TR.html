We present a new approach for reasoning about liveness properties of
distributed systems, represented as automata. Our approach is based on
simulation relations, and requires reasoning only over finite
execution fragments. Current simulation-relation based methods for
reasoning about liveness properties of automata require reasoning over
entire executions, since they involve a proof obligation of the form:
if a concrete and abstract execution ``correspond'' via the
simulation, and the concrete execution is live, then so is the
abstract execution.

<p>
Our contribution consists of (1) a formalism for defining liveness
properties, (2) a proof method for liveness properties based on that
formalism, and (3) two expressive completeness results:
firstly, our formalism can express any liveness property
which satisfies a natural ``robustness'' condition, and
secondly,  our formalism can express any liveness
property at all, provided that history variables can be used.

<p>
To define liveness, we generalize the notion of a complemented-pairs
(Streett) automaton to an infinite state-space, and an infinite number
of complemented-pairs.  Our proof method provides two main techniques:
one for refining liveness properties across levels of abstraction, and
the other for refining liveness properties within a level of
abstraction.  The first is based on extending simulation relations so
that they relate the liveness properties of an abstract (i.e., higher
level) automaton to those of a concrete (i.e., lower level)
automaton. The second is based on a deductive method for inferring new
liveness properties of an automaton from already established liveness
properties of the same automaton.  This deductive method is
diagrammatic, and is based on constructing ``lattices'' of liveness
properties. Thus, it supports proof decomposition and separation of
concerns.
