</p><p> We present two polynomial-time algorithms for automatic
verification of deadlock-freedom of large finite-state concurrent
programs.  We consider shared-memory concurrent programs in which a
process can nondeterministically choose amongst several (enabled)
actions at any step.  As shown by Ladkin and Simons, deadlock-freedom
analysis is NP-hard even for concurrent programs of restricted form
(no nondeterministic choice).  Therefore, research in this area
concentrates either on the search for efficiently checkable sufficient
conditions for deadlock-freedom, or on improving the complexity of the
check in some special cases.  We take the first approach: if our
algorithms return a positive answer, then the program is actually
deadlock-free, while a negative answer conveys no information.


Our algorithms apply to programs which are expressed in a particular
syntactic form, in which variables are shared between pairs of
processes.  The first algorithm is an improvement of the deadlock
check of 
<a href="http://www.cs.aub.edu.lb/pa07/files/papers/TOPLAS98.html">
Attie and Emerson</a>.  Its complexity is polynomial
in all its parameters, as opposed to the exponential complexity of the
deadlock check of Attie and Emerson.  The second algorithm involves a
conceptually new construction of a ``global wait-for graph'' for all
processes. Its running time is also polynomial in all its parameters,
and it is more discriminating than the first algorithm.

We illustrate our algorithms by applying them to several examples of
concurrent programs that implement resource allocation and priority
queues.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
describes polynomially checkable conditions for assuring deadlock
freedom of large concurrent programs.
