Crucial to the programming and debugging of complex aspect-oriented
programs is the ability to specify and monitor temporal ordering
amongst join-points.  We present a temporal logic specification
of such constraints in AspectJ. This provides a formal semantics
for join-point occurrences and is a step towards the formal
verification of AOP programs.  We illustrate the usefulness
of this approach through the formalization and implementation
of aspects in AspectJ.
