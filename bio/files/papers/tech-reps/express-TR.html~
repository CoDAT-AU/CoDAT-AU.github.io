We present a <i>pairwise normal form</i> for finite-state shared memory
concurrent programs: all variables are shared between exactly two processes, and
the guards on transitions are conjunctions of conditions over this pairwise
shared state. This representation has been used to efficiently (in polynomial
time) synthesize and model-check correctness properties of concurrent programs.
Our main result is that any finite state concurrent program can be transformed
into pairwise normal form. Specifically, if $Q$ is an arbitrary finite-state
shared memory concurrent program, then there exists a finite-state
shared memory concurrent program $P$ expressed in pairwise normal form such that
$P$ is strongly bisimilar to $Q$. Our result is constructive: we give an
algorithm for producing $P$, given $Q$.
