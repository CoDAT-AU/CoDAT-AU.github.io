We study the problem of devising wait-free consensus protocols that
tolerate Byzantine failures. We show that wait-free Byzantine agreement cannot
be achieved even in the presence of a single faulty (i.e., Byzantine)
process. We further show that wait-free weak Byzantine
agreement cannot be achieved if shared objects are ``resettable,''
i.e., can be reset to an initial state from any of their reachable states by an
appropriate sequence of operations. Resettable objects are preferable to
non-resettable objects, since they can be reused more easily. We introduce a
non-resettable object, a ``sticky register,'' which is a straightforward
generalization of the sticky type of Jayanti, and use it to devise a solution
to wait-free weak Byzantine agreement that tolerates any number of faulty
processes.  Our impossibility results hold even if we can limit any process
(including Byzantine processes) to invoking objects in a particular fixed set
(i.e., impose a particular ``access pattern'').  Finally, we study the problem
of repetitive wait-free weak Byzantine agreement: how to solve a sequence
of successive instances of agreement. A straightforward solution uses an
unbounded number of sticky registers---one for each instance of agreement. We
show how to bound the number of registers needed by using failure detectors and
weakening the wait-freedom property of the solution.
