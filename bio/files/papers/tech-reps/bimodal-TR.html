We introduce an alternative approach to congestion avoidance and
control, which has the potential to increase efficiency and fairness
in multiplexed channels.  Our approach, Bimodal Congestion Avoidance
and Control, is based on the principles of TCP's Additive Increase
Multiplicative Decrease, but extends it by making an explicit estimate
of the fair share per flow. 
It is designed to better exploit the system
properties during equilibrium, without trading off responsiveness for
smoothness. In addition, it is capable of achieving convergence to
fairness in only two congestion cycles. As a result, both efficiency
and fairness are improved, responsiveness is not degraded, and
smoothness is significantly improved when the system is in
equilibrium.  We provide a theoretical analysis for both static and
dynamic environments and we discuss the potential of our approach for
packet networks. We show that in the model of Chiu and Jain, our
method can calculate the fair share exactly. 
Our method and its analysis is based on the idea of 
\emph{common knowledge}, from the distributed computing literature,
which we introduce in this paper as a concept for thinking about
fair share estimation and congestion control.
Our experiments confirm that Bimodal Congestion
Avoidance and Control as a component of the Transmission Control
Protocol outperforms the traditional scheme.
