We introduce an alternative approach to congestion avoidance and
control, which has the potential to increase efficiency and fairness
in multiplexed channels.  Our approach, Bimodal Congestion Avoidance
and Control, is based on the principles of TCP's Additive Increase
Multiplicative Decrease.  It is designed to better exploit the system
properties during equilibrium, without trading off responsiveness for
smoothness. In addition, it is capable of achieving convergence to
fairness in only two congestion cycles. As a result, both efficiency
and fairness are improved, responsiveness is not degraded, and
smoothness is significantly improved when the system is in
equilibrium.  We provide a theoretical analysis and we discuss the
potential of our approach for packet networks.  Our experiments
confirm that Bimodal Congestion Avoidance and Control as a component
of the Transmission Control Protocol outperforms the traditional
scheme.
