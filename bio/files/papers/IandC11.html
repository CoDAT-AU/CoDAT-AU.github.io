We study <i>f</i>-resilient services, which are guaranteed to operate as
long as no more than <i>f</i> of the associated processes fail.  We prove
three theorems asserting the impossibility of boosting the resilience
of such services.  Our first theorem allows any connection pattern
between processes and services but assumes these services to be
<i>atomic (linearizable) objects</i>.  This theorem says that no
distributed system in which processes coordinate using <i>f</i>-resilient
atomic objects and reliable registers can solve the consensus problem
in the presence of <i>f+1</i> undetectable process stopping failures.  In
contrast, we show that it is possible to boost the resilience of some
systems solving problems easier than consensus: for example, the
2-set consensus problem is solvable for <i>2n</i> processes and <i>2n-1</i>
failures (i.e., wait-free) using <i>n</i>-process consensus services
resilient to <i>n-1</i> failures (wait-free).  Our proof is short and
self-contained.

We then introduce the larger class of <i>failure-oblivious</i> services.
These are services that cannot use information about failures,
although they may behave more flexibly than atomic objects.
An example of such a service is totally ordered broadcast.
Our second theorem generalizes the first theorem and its proof to
failure-oblivious services.

Our third theorem allows the system to contain <i>failure-aware</i>
services, such as failure detectors, in addition to failure-oblivious
services.

This theorem requires that each failure-aware service be connected to
all processes;
thus, <i>f+1</i> process failures overall can disable all the failure-aware
services.
In contrast, it is possible to boost the resilience of a system
solving consensus using failure-aware services if arbitrary connection
patterns between processes and services are allowed:
consensus is solvable for any number of failures using only
1-resilient 2-process perfect failure detectors.

As far as we know, this is the first time a unified framework has been
used to describe both atomic and non-atomic objects, and the first time
boosting analysis has been performed for services more general than
atomic objects.</br>
