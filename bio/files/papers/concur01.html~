We present a mathematical state-machine model, the {\em Dynamic I/O
Automaton (DIOA) model\/}, for defining and analyzing {\em dynamic
systems\/} of interacting components.
The systems we consider are dynamic in two senses:
(1) components can be created and destroyed as computation proceeds, and
(2) the events in which the components may participate may change.
The new model admits a notion of {\em external system behavior\/},
based on sets of traces.
It also features a {\em parallel composition\/} operator for dynamic
systems, which respects external behavior,
and a notion of {\em simulation\/} from one dynamic system to
another, which can be used to prove that one system implements the
other.

<p>
The DIOA model was defined to support the analysis of {\em mobile agent
systems\/}, in a joint project with researchers at Nippon Telephone
and Telegraph.
It can also be used for other forms of dynamic systems, such as
systems described by means of object-oriented programs, and systems
containing services with changing access permissions.
