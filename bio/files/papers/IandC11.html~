We present a new approach, based on simulation relations, for
reasoning about liveness properties of distributed systems.  Our
contribution consists of (1) a formalism for defining liveness
properties, (2) a proof method for liveness properties based on that
formalism, and (3) two expressive completeness results: our
formalism can express any liveness property which satisfies a natural
``robustness'' condition; and also any
liveness property at all, provided that history variables can be used.
To define liveness, we generalize complemented-pairs
(Streett) automata to an infinite state-space, and an infinite number
of complemented-pairs.  Our proof method provides two techniques:
one for refining liveness properties across levels of abstraction, and
another for refining liveness properties within a level of
abstraction.  The first is based on extending simulation relations so
that they relate the liveness properties of an abstract
automaton to those of a concrete
automaton. The second is based on a deductive method for inferring new
liveness properties of an automaton from already established liveness
properties of the same automaton.  This deductive method is
diagrammatic, and is based on constructing ``lattices'' of liveness
properties.
