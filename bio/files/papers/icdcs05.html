We study f-resilient services, which tolerate up to f
failures of client processes.  We prove two theorems about
the impossibility of boosting the resilience of such
services.  Our first theorem allows any connection pattern
between processes and services but assumes these services to
be atomic objects.  The theorem says that no distributed
system in which processes coordinate using reliable
registers and f-resilient atomic objects can solve the
consensus problem in the presence of f+1 undetectable
process stopping failures. In contrast, we show that it is
possible to boost the resilience of systems solving problems
easier than consensus, e.g., k-set consensus.

We also introduce the larger class of failure-oblivious
services, e.g., totally ordered broadcast. These services
cannot use information about failures, but are not
necessarily atomic objects.  We generalize the first theorem
and its proof to failure-oblivious services.

Our second theorem allows the system to additionally contain
failure-aware services, e.g., failure detectors, but
requires that each failure-aware service be connected to all
processes.  Thus, f+1 process failures overall can disable
all the failure-aware services.  In contrast, the resilience
of a system solving consensus can be boosted if arbitrary
patterns of connectivity are allowed between processes and
failure-aware services: consensus is solvable for any number
of failures using only 1-resilient 2-process perfect failure
detectors.

As far as we know, this is the first time a unified
framework has been used to express atomic and non-atomic
objects, and the first time boosting analysis has been
performed for services more general than atomic objects.
