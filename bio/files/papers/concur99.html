We present a tractable method for synthesizing arbitrarily large
concurrent programs from specifications expressed in temporal
logic. Our method does not explicitly construct the global state
transition diagram of the program to be synthesized, and thereby
avoids <i>state explosion</i>. Instead, it constructs a state
transition diagram for each pair of component processes (of the
program) that interact. This ``pair-program'' embodies all possible
interactions of the two processes. Our method proceeds in two steps.
First, we construct a pair-program for every pair of ``connected''
processes, and analyze these pair-programs for desired correctness
properties. We then take the ``pair processes'' of the pair-programs,
and ``compose'' them in a certain way to synthesize the large
concurrent program. We establish a ``large model'' theorem which shows
that the synthesized large program inherits correctness properties
from the pair-programs.
