Most methods for designing component-based systems and verifying
their compatibility address only the syntactic compatibility of
components; no analysis of run-time behavior is made. Those
methods that do address run-time behavior suffer from
<i>state-explosion</i>:  the exponential increase of the number
of global states, and hence the complexity of the analysis, with
the number of components.  We present a method for designing
component-based systems and verifying their behavioral
compatibility and temporal behavior that is not susceptible to
state explosion. Our method is mostly automatic, with little
manual deduction required, and does not analyze a large system
of connected components at once, but instead analyzes components
two-at-a-time. This pair-wise approach enables the automatic
verification of temporal behavior, using model-checking, in time
polynomial in the number and size of all components.  Our method
checks that behavior of a pair of interacting components
conforms to given properties, specified in temporal logic.
Interaction of the components is captured in a product of their
behavioral automata, which are provided as a part of each
component's interface. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method by applying it to the design and verification of a
component-based elevator control algorithm.
