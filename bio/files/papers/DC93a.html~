In this paper, a new fairness notion is proposed for languages
withmulti-party interactions as the sole interprocess synchronization
and communication primitive. The main advantage of this fairness
notion is the elimination of starvation occurring solely due to race
conditions (i.e., ordering of independent actions). Also, this is the
first fairness notion for such languages which is fully adequate with
respect to the criteria suggested by Apt, Francez, and Katz.
The paper defines the
notion, proves its properties, and presents examples of its
usefulness.
