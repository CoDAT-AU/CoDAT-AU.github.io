We present a decision algorithm for the following problem:
given a specification, does
there exist a concurrent program which both satisfies the specification and
which can be implemented in hardware-available operations in a straightforward
manner, i.e, without long correctness proofs, and without
introducing excessive blocking and/or centralization?
In case our decision algorithm answers ``yes,'' we also present a synthesis
method to produce such a program. We consider specifications expressed in
branching time temporal logic. Our result gives a way of classifying
specifications as either ``easy to implement'' or ``difficult to implement,''
and can be regarded as the first step towards a notion of ``implementation
complexity'' of specifications.
