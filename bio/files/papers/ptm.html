</p><p> We present Persistent Turing Machines (PTMs), a new way of
interpreting Turing- machine computation, one that is both interactive
and persistent. A PTM is a nondeterministic 3-tape Turing machine that
upon receiving an input token, com- putes for a while and then outputs
the result, and this process is repeated forever.  It is persistent in
the sense that the work-tape contents are maintained from one
computation (macrostep) to the next.

<p>
We show that the class of PTMs is isomorphic to a very general class
of ef- fective transition systems. One may therefore conclude that the
extensions to the Turing-machine model embodied in PTMs are sufficient
to make Turing machines expressively equivalent to transition systems.

<p>
We also define the persistent stream language (PSL) of a PTM and a
correspond- ing notion of PSL-equivalence, and consider the infinite
hierarchy of successively finer equivalences for PTMs over finite
interaction-stream prefixes. We show that the limit of this hierarchy
is strictly coarser than PSL-equivalence, a "gap" whose presence can
be attributed to the fact that the transition systems corresponding to
PTM computations naturally exhibit unbounded nondeterminism. We note
that this gap is not present for decider PTMs, an important class of
PTMs analogous to decider Turing machines.

<p>
We also consider the class of amnesic PTMs and a corresponding notion
of equivalence based on amnesic stream languages (ASLs). It can be
argued that amnesic stream languages are representative of the
classical view of Turing-machine computation. We show that the class
of ASLs is strictly contained in the class of PSLs.  Furthermore, the
hierarchy of PTM equivalence relations collapses for the subclass of
amnesic PTMs. These results indicate that, in a stream-based setting,
the extension of the Turing-machine model with persistence is a
nontrivial one.

<p>
The notion of a universal PTM is then introduced and a proof of its
existence is presented. We also define the class of sequential
interactive computation, illustrating it with several examples. In an
analogous fashion to the Church-Turing Thesis, we hypothesize that
anything intuitively computable by a sequential interactive
computation can be computed by a persistent Turing machine.
