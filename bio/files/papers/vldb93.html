Extensions of the traditional atomic transaction model are needed to
support the development of multi-system applications or workflows that
access heterogeneous databases and legacy application systems.  Most
extended transaction models use conditions involving events or
dependencies between transactions.  {\em Intertask dependencies} can
serve as a uniform framework for defining extended transaction models.
In this paper, we introduce event attributes needed to determine
whether a dependency is enforceable and to properly schedule events in
extended transaction models.  Using these attributes and a
formalization of a dependency into the temporal logic CTL, we can
automatically synthesize an automaton that captures the computations
that satisfy the given dependency.  We show how a set of such automata
can be combined into a {\em scheduler} that produces global
computations satisfying all relevant dependencies.  We show how
dependencies required to implement relaxed transactions such as Sagas
can be enforced and discuss briefly the issues of concurrency control,
safety, and recoverability.
