Given a program P, one can construct a Kripke structure M.  Model checking verifies that P satisfies a behavioral property given by a temporal logic formula f by checking that M models f.  However, M can be exponentially large in f.  The action of a symmetry group G on M and f can produce a smaller structure M'.  When M does not satisfy f, one can look for a substructure that satisfies f. We call this substructure-repair.  We show that repairs of M' lift to repairs of M, i.e., we can repair a concurrent program by repairing the smaller structure M' and symmetrizing the resulting program.  The substructures of M' map to substructures of M preserved by G.

We present relative completeness results, which give conditions under which the existence of a repair of M implies the existence of a repair of M'.  In cases where there is no repair of a Kripke structure M wrt a formula, we show that there are instances where it is possible to "unwind" M to generate a structure M'' that is strongly bisimilar to M and for which a repair exists. This leads to a natural semantic notion, repairability, which is not preserved by strong bisimulation.  We illustrate the combined use of symmetry reduction and unwinding to effect a repair.

Finally, we provide closed-form results for the reductions in number of states in the Kripke structure that can be achieved by symmetry reduction.
