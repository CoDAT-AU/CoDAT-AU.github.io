We consider the subtractive model repair problem: given a finite
Kripke structure M and a CTL formula f, determine if M contains a
substructure M' that satisfies f. Thus, M can be 'repaired' to satisfy
f by deleting some transitions and states. We map an instance (M, f)
of model repair to a boolean formula repair(M, f) such that (M, f)
has a solution iff repair(M, f) is satisfiable. Furthermore, a
satisfying assignment determines which states and transitions must
be removed from M to yield a model M' of f. Thus, we can use any SAT
solver to repair Kripke structures. Using a complete SAT solver yields
a complete algorithm: it always finds a repair if one exists. We also
show that CTL model repair is NP-complete. We extend the basic repair
method in three directions: (1) the use of abstraction mappings, i.e.,
repair a structure abstracted from M and then concretize the resulting
repair to obtain a repair of M, (2) repair concurrent Kripke
structures and concurrent programs: we use the pairwise method of
Attie and Emerson to represent and repair the behavior of a
concurrent program, as a set of 'concurrent Kripke structures', with
only a quadratic increase in the size of the repair formula, and (3)
repair hierarchical Kripke structures: we use a CTL formula to
summarize the behavior of each 'box', and CTL deduction to relate the
box formula with the overall specification.
