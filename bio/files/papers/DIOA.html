We present dynamic I/O automata (DIOA), a compositional model of
dynamic systems, based on I/O automata.  In our model, automata can be
created and destroyed dynamically, as computation proceeds.  In
addition, an automaton can dynamically change its signature, that is,
the set of actions in which it can participate.  This allows us to
model mobility, by enforcing the constraint that only automata at the
same location may synchronize on common actions.

Our model features operators for parallel composition, action hiding,
and action renaming.  It also features a notion of automaton creation,
and a notion of trace inclusion from one dynamic system to another,
which can be used to prove that one system implements the other.  Our
model is hierarchical: a dynamically changing system of interacting
automata is itself modeled as a single automaton that is ``one level
higher.'' This can be repeated, so that an automaton that represents
such a dynamic system can itself be created and destroyed. We can thus
model the addition and removal of entire subsystems with a single
action.

We establish fundamental compositionality results for DIOA: if one
component is replaced by another whose traces are a subset of the
former, then the set of traces of the system as a whole can only be
reduced, and not increased, i.e., no new behaviors are added.  That
is, parallel composition, action hiding, and action renaming, are all
monotonic with respect to trace inclusion.  We also show that, under
certain technical conditions, automaton creation is monotonic with
respect to trace inclusion: if a system creates automaton A_i instead
of (previously) creating automaton A'_i, and the traces of A_i are a
subset of the traces of A'_i, then the set of traces of the overall
system is possibly reduced, but not increased.  Our trace inclusion
results imply that trace equivalence is a congruence relation with
respect to parallel composition, action hiding, and action renaming.

Our trace inclusion results enable a design and refinement methodology
based solely on the notion of externally visible behavior, and which
is therefore independent of specific methods of establishing trace
inclusion.  It permits the refinement of components and subsystems in
isolation from the entire system, and provides more flexibility in
refinement than a methodology which is, for example, based on the
monotonicity of forward simulation with respect to parallel
composition. In the latter, every automaton must be refined using
forward simulation, whereas in our framework different automata can be
refined using different methods.

The DIOA model was defined to support the analysis of mobile agent
systems, in a joint project with researchers at Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone.  It can also be used for other forms of dynamic systems,
such as systems described by means of object-oriented programs, and
systems containing services with changing access permissions.
