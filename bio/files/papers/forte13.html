</p><p> We present a sound but incomplete criterion for checking
deadlock freedom of finite state systems expressed in BIP: a
component-based framework for the construction of complex distributed
systems. Since deciding deadlock-freedom for finite-state concurrent
systems is PSPACE-complete, our criterion gives up completeness in
return for tractability of evaluation. Our criterion can be evaluated
by model-checking subsystems of the overall large system. The size of
these subsystems depends only on the local topology of direct
interaction between components, and not on the number of components in
the overall system.  We present two experiments, in which our method
compares favorably with existing approaches. For example, in verifying
deadlock freedom of dining philosphers, our method shows linear
increase in computation time with the number of philosophers, whereas
other methods (even those that use abstraction) show super-linear
increase, due to state-explosion.
