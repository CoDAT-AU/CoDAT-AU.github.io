</p><p> We present a criterion for checking local and global deadlock
freedom of finite state systems expressed in BIP: a component-based
framework for the construction of complex distributed systems. Our
criterion is evaluated by model-checking a set of subsystems of the
overall large system. If satisfied in small subsystems, it implies
deadlock-freedom of the overall system. If not satisfied, then we
re-evaluate over larger subsystems, which improves the accuracy of the
check. When the subsystem being checked becomes the entire system, our
criterion becomes complete for deadlock-freedom. Hence our criterion
can only fail to decide deadlock-freedom because of computational
limitations: state-space explosion sets in when the subsystems being
checked become too large. Our method thus combines the possibility of
fast response together with theoretical completeness. Other criteria
for deadlock-freedom, in contrast, are incomplete in principle, and so
may fail to decide deadlock-freedom even if unlimited computational
resources are available. Also, our criterion certifies freedom from
local deadlock, in which a subsystem is deadlocked while the rest of
the system executes. We present experimental results for dining
philosophers and for a multi token-based resource allocation system,
which subsumes several data arbiters and schedulers, including
Milner’s token based scheduler.
