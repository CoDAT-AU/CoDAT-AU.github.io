This paper describes a comparative study of three formal methods for
modeling and validating agent systems.  The study is part of a
joint project by researchers in MIT's Theory of Distributed Systems
research group and NTT's Cooperative Computing research group.  Our
goal is to establish a mathematical and linguistic foundation for
describing and reasoning about agent-style systems.
