We consider the following model repair problem: given a finite Kripke
structure M and a CTL formula f, determine if M
contains a substructure M' that satisfies f. That is, M can be
``repaired'' to satisfy f by deleting some transitions.

We map an instance (M,f) of model repair to a boolean formula
repair(M,f) such that (M,f) has a solution iff
repair(M,f) is satisfiable. Furthermore, a satisfying assignment
determines which transitions must be removed from M to generate a
model M' of f. Thus, we can use any SAT solver to repair
Kripke structures. We also reduce satisfiability to model repair, 
and hence show that model repair is NP-complete.

We extend the basic repair method in several directions, as follows.
(1) use abstraction: we repair a structure abstracted from M
and then concretize the resulting repair to obtain a repair of M, and 
(2) repair concurrent Kripke structures: we use the pairwise method of
Attie and Emerson to represent and repair the behavior of a concurrent
program, as a set of ``concurrent Kripke structures'', with only a
quadratic increase in the size of the repair formula, and
(3) repair hierarchical Kripke structures: we use a CTL
formula to summarize the behavior of each ``box'', and CTL deduction
to relate the box formula with the overall specification.
