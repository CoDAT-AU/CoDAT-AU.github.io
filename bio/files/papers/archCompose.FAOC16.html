Architectures depict design principles: paradigms that can be
understood by all, allow thinking on a higher plane and avoiding
low-level mistakes.  They provide means for ensuring correctness by
construction by enforcing global properties characterizing the
coordination between components.  An architecture can be considered as
an operator $A$ that, applied to a set of components $\cB$, builds a
composite component $A(\cB)$ meeting a characteristic property $\Phi$.
Architecture composability is a basic and common problem faced by
system designers.<BR>
  
In this paper, we propose a formal and general framework for
architecture composability based on an associative, commutative and
idempotent architecture composition operator $\arcomp$.  The main
result is that if two architectures $A_1$ and $A_2$ enforce
respectively safety properties $\Phi_1$ and $\Phi_2$, the architecture
$A_1 \arcomp A_2$ enforces the property $\Phi_1 \land \Phi_2$, that is
both properties are preserved by architecture composition.  We also
establish preservation of
liveness properties by architecture composition.  The presented
results are illustrated by a running example and a case study.
