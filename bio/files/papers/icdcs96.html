We present a new algorithm for detecting generalized deadlocks in
distributed systems.  Our algorithm incrementally constructs and
reduces a wait-for-graph (WFG) at an initiator process. This WFG is
then searched for deadlock. The proposed algorithm has two primary
advantages: First, it avoids sending messages along the edges of the
global wait-for-graph, thereby achieving a worst-case message
complexity of <i>2n</i>, where <i>n</i>  is the number of processes in
the WFG. Since information must be obtained from every process
reachable from the initiator, this is optimal to within a constant
factor. All existing algorithms for deadlock detection construct a
distributed snapshot of the WFG. As this involves sending messages
along the edges of the WFG, the best available message complexity
among these algorithms is <i>4e - 2n + 2l</i>, which is <i>O(n^2)</i>
in the worst case, where <i>e</i> and <i>l</i> are the number of edges
and leaves in the WFG, respectively. Second, since the information
about a detected deadlock is readily available at the initiator
process, rather than distributed among different processes, it
significantly simplifies the task of deadlock resolution, and helps to
reduce system overhead associated with the resolution. The time
complexity of our algorithm is also better than or equal to the
existing algorithms.
