Methods for mechanically synthesizing concurrent programs from
temporal logic specifications have been proposed by Emerson and Clarke
and by Manna and Wolper.  An important advantage of these synthesis
methods is that they obviate the need to manually compose a program
and manually construct a proof of its correctness. A serious drawback
of these methods in practice, however, is that they produce concurrent
programs for models of computation that are often unrealistic,
involving highly centralized system architecture (Manna and Wolper),
processes with global information about the system state (Emerson and
Clarke), or reactive modules that can read all of their inputs in one
atomic step (Anuchitanukul and Manna, and Pnueli and Rosner). Even
simple synchronization protocols based on atomic read/write primitives
such as Peterson's solution to the mutual exclusion problem have
remained outside the scope of practical mechanical synthesis methods.
In this paper, we show how to mechanically synthesize in more
realistic computational models (specifically, atomic read/write)
solutions to synchronization
problems. We illustrate the method by synthesizing Peterson's solution
to the mutual exclusion problem.

This is the first paper to mechanically synthesize Peterson's solution from a 
formal specification, a problem suggested by Amir Pnueli.
