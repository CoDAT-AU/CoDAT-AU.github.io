We present a mathematical state-machine model, the <i>Dynamic I/O
Automaton (DIOA) model</i>, for defining and analyzing 
<i>dynamic systems</i> of interacting components.
The systems we consider are dynamic in two senses:
(1) components can be created and destroyed as computation proceeds, and
(2) the events in which the components may participate may change.
The new model admits a notion of <i>external system behavior</i>,
based on sets of traces.
It also features a <i>parallel composition</i> operator for dynamic
systems, which respects external behavior,
and a notion of <i>simulation</i> from one dynamic system to
another, which can be used to prove that one system implements the
other.

<p>
The DIOA model was defined to support the analysis of
<i>mobile agent systems</i>, in a joint project with researchers at
Nippon Telephone and Telegraph.  It can also be used for other forms
of dynamic systems, such as systems described by means of
object-oriented programs, and systems containing services with
changing access permissions.
