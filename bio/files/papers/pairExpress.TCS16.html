We show that any finite-state shared-memory concurrent program can be transformed
into <i>pairwise normal form</i>: all variables are shared between exactly two processes, and
the guards on transitions are conjunctions of conditions over this pairwise
shared state. 
Specifically, if <i>P</i> is a finite-state shared-memory concurrent
program, then there exists a finite-state shared-memory concurrent
program <b>P</b> expressed in pairwise normal form such that  <b>P</b>  is
strongly bisimilar to  <b>P</b>.  Our result is constructive: we give an
algorithm for producing  <b>P</b>, given  <i>P</i>.
