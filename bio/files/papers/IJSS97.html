The idea of successively refining an abstract specification until it
contains enough details to suggest an implementation has been investigated by
numerous researchers. The emphasis to date has been on techniques that,
unfortunately, lead to a large amount of manual formal labor for each
refinement step.  With such techniques, both the cost and the possibility
of errors arising in formal manipulation are high. Using a theorem prover
can reduce the number of manipulation errors, but, given current
technology, the amount of labor is still daunting.
This research explores an alternative solution to the refinement
problem, namely the use of syntactic transformations
to realize each refinement step. We reduce formal labor by employing
automatic transformations that guarantee the preservation of desirable
properties --- e.g., deadlock-freedom. Automatic transformations are
particularly appealing for the development of large, complex distributed
systems, where a manual approach to refinement would be prohibitively expensive.
Distributed computations are, by nature, reactive and concurrent, so their
correctness cannot be specified as a simple functional relationship
between inputs and outputs.  Instead, specifications must describe the
time-varying behavior of the system. Further difficulty is caused by the
fact that such important characteristics of distribution as
deadlock-freedom are global properties that cannot be achieved through
considering local structures only. Transformations generally must
encompass the entire system.

This paper presents two syntactic transformations --- the
left-sequence introduction and the right-sequence introduction --- and
demonstrates that they preserve deadlock-freedom.
