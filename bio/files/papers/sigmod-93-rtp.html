The Carnot Project at MCC is addressing the problem of 
logically unifying physically-distributed, enterprise-wide, 
heterogeneous information. Carnot will provide a user with 
the means to navigate information efficiently and 
transparently, to update that information consistently, and 
to write applications easily for large, heterogeneous, 
distributed information systems. A prototype has been 
implemented which provides services for (a) enterprise 
modeling and model integration to create an enterprise- 
wide view, (b) semantic expansion of queries on the view to 
queries on individual resources, and (c) inter-resource 
consistency management. This paper describes the Carnot 
approach to transaction processing in environments where 
heterogeneous, distributed, and autonomous systems are 
required to coordinate the update of the local information 
under their control. In this approach, subtransactions are 
represented as a set of tasks and a set of intertask 
dependencies that capture the semantics of a particular 
relaxed transaction model. A scheduler has been 
implemented which schedules the execution of these tasks in 
the Carnot environment so that all intertask dependencies 
are satisfied.
