We present a methodology for designing component-based systems and
verifying their temporal behavior properties.  Our verification method
is mostly automatic, and is not susceptible to the well-known
\emph{state-explosion} problem, which has hitherto severely limited
the practical applicability of automatic verification methods.  Our
method specifies the externally visible behavior of each component $C$
as several \emph{behavioral interface automaton} ({\BIA}), one for each
of the other components which $C$ interacts directly with.  A {\BIA} is a
finite-state automaton whose transitions can be labeled with method
calls.  For each pair of directly interacting components, we compute
the product of the {\BIA}. These ``pair machines'' are then verified
mechanically.  The verified ``pair properties'' are then combined deductively 
to deduce global properties. Since the pair-machines are the product of
only two components, they are small, and so their mechanical
verification, e.g., by model checking, does not run up against
state-explosion.  The use of several {\BIA} per component enables a clean
separation between interfaces, so that the interactions of a component
$C$ with several other components are cleanly separated, and can be
inspected in isolation.  This in itself promotes the understandability
of a design.  Our method also enhances extensibility. If a component
is modified, only the pairs in which that component is involved are
affected. The rest of the system is undisturbed.  To our knowledge,
our method is the first approach to behavioral compatibility that does
not suffer from state-explosion.
