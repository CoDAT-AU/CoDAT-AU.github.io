</p><p> We present two polynomial-time algorithms for automatic
verification of deadlock-freedom of large finite-state concurrent
programs.  We consider shared-memory concurrent programs in which a
process can nondeterministically choose amongst several (enabled)
actions at any step.  As shown by Ladkin and Simons, deadlock-freedom
analysis is NP-hard even for concurrent programs of restricted form
(no nondeterministic choice).  Therefore, research in this area
concentrates either on the search for efficiently checkable sufficient
conditions for deadlock-freedom, or on improving the complexity of the
check in some special cases.  In this paper, we present two
efficiently checkable sufficient conditions for deadlock freedom.

Our algorithms apply to programs which are expressed in a particular
syntactic form, in which variables are shared between pairs of
processes.  The first algorithm improves the complexity of the
deadlock check of 
<A HREF="papers/TOPLAS04.html">Attie and Emerson [AE98]</A> 
to polynomial in all
parameters, as opposed to the exponential complexity of [AE98].
The second algorithm involves a conceptually new construction of a
``global wait-for graph'' for all processes. Its running time is also
polynomial in all its parameters, and it is more discriminating than
the first algorithm.  We illustrate our algorithms by applying them to
several examples of concurrent programs that implement resource
allocation and priority queues.  To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work that describes polynomially checkable conditions for
assuring deadlock freedom of large concurrent programs.
