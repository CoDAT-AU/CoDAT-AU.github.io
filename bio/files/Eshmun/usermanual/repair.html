        <p>
        You can repair any model after inputing its specifications, to do so simply
        go to the Tools Menu -> Model Repair (F9). Model Repair will be carried out for the
        entire open structure.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        After model repair is complete, the result is displayed in the status panel (bottom
        right corner of the screen), with the time required in nano seconds. The deleted transitions and 
        states appear dashed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        To restore the dashed transitions and states, you can go to Tools Menu
        -> Restore Transitions.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        You can completely deleted the dashed transitions and states, to do so go to Tools Menu -> Delete Dashed.
        </p>
        
        <p>

        search box (top right corner), Finding newer repairs be costier than the initial model repair, 
        it requires repairing again. Finding previous repairs is fast, since they are already saved.
