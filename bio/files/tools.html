CoDAT is a tool designed to maintain consistency between the various
levels of code documentation, e.g. if a line in a code sketch is
changed, the comment that documents the corresponding code is also
changed. That is, comments are linked and updated so as to remain
internally consistent and also consistent with the code. By flagging
"out of date" comments, CoDAT alerts the developer to maintain
up-to-date documentation.

<p>
We use a large language model to check the semantic consistency
between a fragment of code and the comments that describe it. Thus we
also flag semantic inconsistency as well as out of date comments. This
helps programers write code that correctly implements a code sketch,
and so provides machine support for a step-wise refinement approach,
starting with a code sketch and proceeding down to code through one or
more refinement iterations.  CoDAT is implemented in the Intellij IDEA
IDE where we use the Code Insight daemon package alongside a custom
regular expression algorithm to mark tagged comments whose
corresponding code blocks have changed. CoDAT's
backend is structurally decentralized to allow a distributed ledger
framework for code consistency and architectural compilation tracking.

This work presents an algorithm which takes a Kripke structure <i>M</i> and
temporal logic formula <i>f</i>, and modifies  <i>M</i>, by removing 'violating'
transitions, so that  <i>M</i> satisfies <i>f</i>. The algorithm has been implemented
as the tool <b>Eshmun</b>, and has been applied
successfully to many examples, including mutual exclusion, dining
pholosophers, barrier-synchronization,
automated teller machine. 
Kripke structures can serve as finite-state models for non-terminating
reactive programs, and so this work has application in the
specification and modeling of reactive systems.
The Eshmun tool and a technical report describing this work can be downloaded
<A HREF="http://eshmuntool.blogspot.com">here</A>.
A user manual for Eshmun is available <A HREF="Eshmun/usermanual/index.html">here</A>.
The following paperz presents Eshmun.

<i>Synopsis</i>: 
Presents a method for the repair of Kripke structures and concurrent
programs so that they satisfy a specification in the temporal logic CTL.
The method is implemented in the GUI-based tool <a href="http://eshmuntool.blogspot.com/">Eshmun</a>.
