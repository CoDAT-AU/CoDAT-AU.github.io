My research addresses the conceptual difficuly and the computational complexity of the design and
verification of large concurrent software systems. I have produced models and results for 
<a href="#DIOA">complex dynamic behavior (DIOA)</a>, 

<a href="#deadlockFreedom">deadlock freedom</a>, 

<a href="#faultTolerance">fault-tolerance</a> (impossiblity of boosting fault-tolerance) and for

reducing the complexity of reasoning about finite-state concurrent programs 
(<a href="#pairwise">pairwise normal form</a> and 
<a href="#architectures"> software architectures</a>).  

By representing a finite-state concurrent program in pairwise normal form, 
I have also produced algorithms for tractable (polynomial time)
checking of deadlock-freedom, safety, and livness of finite-state concurrent programs.
Software architectures enforce correctness properties by applying coordinators to a concurrent program, so post hoc verification is not necessary.

I have devised a method for the <a href="#repair"> automatic repair</a>
of a finite Kripke structure so that it satisfies a given CTL formula, 
and have implemented this method in the <a href="http://eshmuntool.blogspot.com/">Eshmun</a> tool.
By extending the repair method to pairwise normal form, Eshmun is capable of repairing state-spaces of up to 
3<sup>50</sup> states. Repair can also be applied to concurrent programs.







<br><br>
<a name="DIOA"></a>
<p></p><li><b>Dynamic input-output automata (DIOA) </b><br>

<p> Together with Nancy Lynch, I have devised the Dynamic Input-Output Automaton (DIOA) model <a href="#AL16">[AL16]</a>, which extends Lynch's
well-known Input-Output Automaton model to deal with
<font color="red">dynamic process creation and dynamic change of behavior</font>.
DIOA enables a process to
change, at run time, the set of actions in which it is willing to participate, and it enables new processes to be created by the execution of an
action. A process can self-destruct by setting its actions to the empty set. We establish monotonicity of trace inclusion w.r.t. parallel composition,
action hiding, action renaming, and process creation: in a global system, replacing a single process by one with fewer traces cannot cause the new
system to have more traces than the original one.


<br><br>
<a name="deadlockFreedom"></a>
</p><p></p></li><li><b>Deadlock-freedom of concurrent programs</b><br>

<p> We give a sufficient criterion, for the
<font color="red">deadlock freedom</font> of large concurrent programs. In the finite-state case, this criterion can often be verified
by checking small subsystems <a href="#ABBJSA13">[ABBJSA13, </a> <a href="#ABBJSA16">ABBJSA16]</a> of the overall large program.  The criterion uses
the notion of supercycle, first introduced in <a href="#AE98">[AE98], </a>.  We show that the notion of supercycle is the first (to our knowledge)
characterization of deadlock in concurrent programs 
(where processes have local nondeterministic choice of which event to execute) that is both sound <i>and complete</i> for deadlock-freedom.
Completeness is
sacrificed only by restricting evaluation to small subsystems. Hence we have early stopping in some cases, together with theoretical completeness.
Since all common formalisms (I/O automata, BIP, CSP, CCS, pi-calculus, etc) allow local nondeterminism, ours is the first sound and complete 
deadlock criterion for all these formalisms.


<br><br>
<a name="pairwise"></a>
<p></p></li><li><b>Tractable synthesis and verification of concurrent programs via property-preserving pairwise composition</b><br>

<p>
I have devised a representation, <font color="red">pairwise normal form</font>
<a href="#Att16a">[Att16a, </a>
<a href="#Att16b">Att16b]</a>,
for describing a large concurrent program consisting of many processes so that
behavioral properties can be verified by analyzing <i>small subsystems</i>
consisting of a few processes. The key idea is that, for each pair of processes
that interact directly, isolate the code that defines their interaction from all
of the other code in the system.  For example, global mutual exclusion can be
verified by checking mutual exclusion of each pair of processes.  
Subject to some technical conditions,
behavioral property <i>f<sub>ij</sub></i> of the interaction of processes 
<i>P<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>P<sub>j</sub></i>
also holds in the global system
<i>P<sub>1</sub></i> || ... || <i>P<sub>n</sub></i>.  Hence such
pairwise properties can be verified by checking the pair-subsystem 
<i>P<sub>i</sub></i> || <i>P<sub>j</sub></i>
which consists of processes
<i>P<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>P<sub>j</sub></i>
<i>interacting in isolation</i>.

</p><p>
I use pairwise normal form to give an efficient (polynomial in the number of processes) algorithm for the synthesis of concurrent programs
from CTL specifications.
The synthesis method accommodates the  <font color="red">dynamic addition</font> (at run time)  of processes
<a href="#Att16a">[Att16a]:</a>.
new processes can be verified to behave correctly by checking their interaction
with existing components with which the new component directly interacts.

<p>
In addition, the <font color="red">absence of global and local deadlock</font> can be verified by checking small subsystems
<a href="#ABBJSA13">[ABBJSA13]</a> of the overall global system.
Since small subsystems can be analyzed automatically, by model checking, this
approach therefore avoids the verification and analysis difficulties induced by
state-explosion.

</p><p>
The isolation of code in this pairwise manner also enables <b>locality</b>
and <b>modifiability</b>: the system can be understood by reading each piece of
pairwise code by itself, and the system can be modified by changing each piece
of pairwise code by itself.  If the global system currently satisfies
<i>f<sub>ij</sub></i>
(for the interaction between two processes) and we wish to modify it to satisfy
<i>f'<sub>ij</sub></i>, then only the pairwise code that defines the interaction between
<i>P<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>P<sub>j</sub></i> need be modified.



<br><br>
<a name="architectures"></a>
</p><p></p></li><li><b> Software architectures </b><br>

<p>
Another method for achieving locality and modifiability is to
associate each correctness property with a particular
<font color="red">coordinator process</font>
<a href="#ABBJS16">[ABBJS16, </a>
<a href="#ABBJS14">ABBJS14]</a>, which enforces the property. This makes it easy
to verify the property, and to modify it if necessary, since all the
code associated with the property is in one place, instead of being
distributed across many processes. 
Both safety and liveness properties are dealt with.
Liveness is analyzed by checking that every pair of coordinators do
not "interfere" with each other.


<br><br>
<a name="repair"></a>
</p><p></p></li><li><b> Automatic repair, modification, and visualization of run-time behavior: bridging the cognitive gap between syntax and semantics </b><br>

<p> A key challenge in getting software right is the huge discrepancy in complexity between the software itself (syntax, i.e., the code) and the
run-time dynamic behavior of software (semantics). Concurrent algorithms expressible in a few pages of code can have complex behavior, and some
published algorithms have been found (after publication) to be erroneous.

</p><p> For finite-state concurrent programs, I have formalized
<font color="red">mappings from syntax to semantics and semantics to syntax</font> <a href="#AE98">[AE98, </a>
<a href="#AE01">AE01, </a> <a href="#Att16a">Att16a]</a>.  A concurrent program (syntax) is a set of processes, and each process is a is a set of
guarded commands that read and write shared memory.  The semantics of a concurrent program is given by one or more state-transition diagrams (Kripke
structures).  I have implemented a GUI-based tool, <a href="http://eshmuntool.blogspot.com/">Eshmun</a>, which enables the display and modification of
Kripke structures and concurrent programs. Modification can be by manual editing, or by
<font color="red">automatic repair</font>
<a href="#ADS16">[ADS16, </a> <a href="#ACDSS15">ACDSS15]</a> w.r.t. a CTL specification: given a Kripke structure <i>M</i> 
and a CTL formula <i>f</i>, 
a boolean repair formula is generated which is passed to a SAT solver. A satisfying assignment determines which states and transitions must be deleted 
from <i>M</i> so that <i>f</i> is satisfied.

</p><p> By using pairwise normal form, Eshmun can display, modify, and repair state-transition systems with up to 3<sup>50</sup> states, taking between 10
seconds and two minutes to do so, depending on the length of the CTL specification.  In pairwise normal form, the semantics of a concurrent program is
given by a set of <i>pair-structures</i>: for each directly interacting pair of processes, a Kripke structure is given which describes the
interaction. So, 50 process mutual exclusion is represented by 1225 pair-structures, each with 9 states.  These pair-structures can be modified
manually, or can be automatically repaired so as to satisfy a given property <i>f<sub>ij</sub></i>.  A new concurrent program can be automatically
extracted from the modified state-transition system. The repair formula grows only quadratically with number of processes, 
and this enables a large number of processes to be handled.

</p><p> Repair can also be used to <font color="red">synthesize</font> concurrent programs: start with a naive program which permits all possible
transitions, generate its pairwise Kripke structures, repair these, and extract a correct concurrent program from them.



<br><br>
<a name="faultTolerance"></a>
<p></p><li><b>Fault-tolerance in distributed and concurrent systems </b><br>

<p>
A major source of complexity in the design and implementation of
concurrent and distributed software is the possibility of  <font color="red">faults</font>.
In <a href="#AAE04">[AAE04]</a> a method for
<font color="red">synthesizing fault-tolerant concurrent programs from CTL specifications</font> is given.

Also, in <a href="#AGKLS11">[AGKLS11] </a>, the question of
<font color="red">boosting fault-tolerance</font> is treated: given a service that can
tolerate <i>f</i> undetectable crash failures, do there exist
distributed protocols for boosting the fault tolerance to <i>f+1</i>?
We give various conditions for the existence and non-existence of
boosting protocols.
